autojump - a faster way to navigate your filesystem

DESCRIPTION
-----------

autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line.

*Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.*

USAGE
-----

`j` is a convenience wrapper function around `autojump`. Any option that
can be used with `autojump` can be used with `j` and vice versa.

-   Jump To A Directory That Contains `foo`:

        j foo

-   Jump To A Directory That Contains `foo`, Preferring Child Directories:

    You can prioritize child directories over matches in the databases via

        jc foo

-   Open File Manager To Directories (instead of jumping):

    Instead of jumping to a directory, you can open a file explorer
    window (Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, GNOME Nautilus, etc.) to the
    directory instead.

        jo music

    Opening a file manager to a child directory is also supported:

        jco images

-   Using Multiple Arguments:

    Let's assume the following database:

        30   /home/user/mail/inbox
        10   /home/user/work/inbox

    `j in` would jump into /home/user/mail/inbox as the higher
    weighted entry. However you can pass multiple arguments to autojump
    to prefer a different entry. In the above example, `j w in` would
    then change directory to /home/user/work/inbox.

For more options refer to help:

    autojump --help

### AUTOMATIC

#### Linux

autojump is included in the following distro repositories, please use
relevant package management utilities to install (e.g. apt-get, yum,
pacman, etc):

-   Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint

    All Debian-derived distros require manual activation for policy
    reasons, please see `/usr/share/doc/autojump/README.Debian`.

-   RedHat, Fedora, CentOS

    Install `autojump-zsh` for zsh, `autojump-fish` for fish, etc.

Windows support is enabled by [clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/)
which should be installed prior to installing autojump.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

-   autojump does not support directories that begin with `-`.

-   For bash users, autojump keeps track of directories by modifying
    `$PROMPT_COMMAND`. Do not overwrite `$PROMPT_COMMAND`:

        export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"

    Instead append to the end of the existing \$PROMPT\_COMMAND:

        export PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND ;} history -a"
