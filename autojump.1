.IP
.nf

.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.
It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most
from the command line.
The jumpstat command shows you the current contents of the database.
Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.
.SS OPTIONS
.PP
Options must be passed to \[aq]autojump\[aq] and not the \[aq]j\[aq]
wrapper function.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-a,\ --add\ DIR\ \ \ \ \ \ \ manually\ add\ path\ to\ database

--stat\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ show\ database\ entries\ and\ their\ key\ weights

--version\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ show\ version\ information\ and\ exit
\f[]
.fi
.SS INTERNAL OPTIONS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-b,\ --bash\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ enclose\ directory\ with\ quotes\ to\ prevent\ errors

--completion\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ prevent\ key\ weight\ decay\ over\ time

.SS ADVANCED USAGE
.IP \[bu] 2
Prefer Symbolic Links
.RS 2
.PP
Default behavior is to evaluate symbolic links into full paths as to
reduce duplicate entries in the database.
However, some users prefer a shorter working directory path in their
shell prompt.
To switch behavior to prefer symbolic links, export the following
configuration in your ~/.bashrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Change Directory Weight
.RS 2
.PP
To manually change a directory\[aq]s key weight, you can edit the file
\f[I]$XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt\f[].
Each entry has two columns.
The first is the key weight and the second is the path:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
29.3383211216\ \ \ /home/user/downloads
\f[]
.fi
.PP
All negative key weights are purged automatically.
.RE
.SS FILES
.PP
If installed locally, autojump is self-contained in
\f[I]~/.autojump/\f[].
.PP
The database is stored in \f[I]$XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt\f[].
